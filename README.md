#Chronos
Chronos is a frontend for an existing JavaScript stopwatch library. I guess you could find more repo's with the same intent, but I thought my keyboard interaction approach 
could be to use for some people

##Installation
Git Clone or download and just open the index.html file.

##Behavior
The complete package is keyboard driven. Everything is pretty intuitive, the only real arbitrary feature is the export feature, which will pull up a pop-up with the timestamps in a JSON format that fits
our CMS solution over at gamehour.be, but if you want to custom fit it, just edit stopwatch.extension.js:46

##Support and question
Questions can be mailed to im@nielsvermaut.eu or @nielsvermaut at Twitter.
